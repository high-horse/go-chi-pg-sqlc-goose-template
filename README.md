## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.18+ recommended)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [sqlc](https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc) (SQL code generator)
- [Goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) (Database migration tool)

### Installing Dependencies

Clone the repository and install Go modules:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
go mod tidy
```

Install sqlc and goose:

```sh

go install github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@latest
go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
```

#Database Setup

Configure your database connection in the .env file or directly in your configuration. The default PostgreSQL connection string looks like this:

```sh
postgres://postgres:root@localhost:5432/attempt2
```

Running Migrations

To apply all pending migrations, run:

```sh

cd sql/schema
goose postgres postgres://postgres:root@localhost:5432/attempt2 up
```

#To roll back the last migration, run:

```sh

cd sql/schema
goose postgres postgres://postgres:root@localhost:5432/attempt2 down
```
#Code Generation

Generate Go code from SQL queries using sqlc:

```sh

sqlc generate
```
This will generate Go code based on the SQL queries defined in internal/db/queries.sql.
Running the Application

#To start the application, use the following command:

```sh

go run cmd/*.go
```
This will compile and run your Go application.
Configuration

Application configurations are typically handled in config/config.go. You can set up environment variables or use a configuration file to manage your settings.
Logging

Logging is set up in internal/logger/. The project uses a structured logging approach to capture logs efficiently. Adjust the logger setup in logger.go to suit your requirements.
Middleware

Middleware is managed in the internal/handler/ package. Middleware functions provide a way to process requests and responses, and can be used for tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling.
Additional Notes

    Ensure your database is running and accessible before running migrations or starting the application.
    Customize the project structure and components to fit the needs of your application.
    Refer to the documentation of tools like sqlc and goose for advanced usage and configuration options.

Feel free to modify this README.md as needed to better fit the specifics of your project.
